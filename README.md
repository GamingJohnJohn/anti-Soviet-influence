What is the Anti-Soviet Influence?
Unlike any other historical war game, nor 2 or 3 Forces. The Anti-Soviet Influence brings players a breath of fresh, cool air, containing the smell of the bush in Vietnam, Charlton from New Zealand, the first steps into Poland in 1939, the Canadian army in Normandy and more.
The Anti-Soviet Influence allows you to control soldiers from over 20 countries and forces. Embark on an adventure where you must dodge intense fire from the Soviets and their allies, while firing back with a variety of weapons
from conventional weapons like submachine guns, sniper rifles to rare and unique anti-tank rifles, flamethrowers, assault rifles and anti-tank guns
Play the country's famous song 24/7, and mute the music to hear the deadly gunfire
imagine wandering around the European continent while firing rifles at the Soviets and their allies, not bad right?
